## Getting Started

To run the development server, download the repository and navigate to the root directory in a terminal (the directory is named Fetch-Frontend-Challenge if you haven't changed the name) and run the following commands:

```
npm ci
```
after every dependency is installed successfully, run
```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
